Welcome to my Halloween website!

Every year on October 31, millions of kids and even adults dress up with a costume to celebrate Halloween. The most common activity on Halloween is to go trick-or-treating which means going door to door with a bag and collecting free candy from those homes. There is generally a lot of chocolate as well as many other kinds of candies and treats.

The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick or treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats.

COSTUMES PAGE CONTENT

People love to dress up in all sorts of costumes for Halloween. Some of the common, traditional costumes include vampires, ghosts, witches, and various kinds of monsters. However, there are also a lot that are not so scary or evil-spirited, such as princesses, fairies, nurses, superheroes, and beloved cartoon characters. Some dress up as elderly folks, lumberjacks, famous actors or musicians, or police officers.

Young babies and pets are often dressed up in simple costumes like pumpkins, bumblebees, or cats.

Some people prefer to get away from the traditional costumes and use their creativity to come up with very unique outfits. Here are some pretty cool/interesting costumes:
